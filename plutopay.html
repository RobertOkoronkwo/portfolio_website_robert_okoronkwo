					<h2>What is PlutoPay?</h2>
				</div>
		<div>
			<p>
				PlutoPay is a web responsive application which allows anyone to instantly transfer money
				digitally through the platform without the need of a physical bank or store.
			</p>

			<p>
	 	The problem I resolved in this project was to better aid users in regards to their personal finances.
		Whether it is paying a friend for movie tickets, planning ahead for bill payments, or buying an item
		from a buy/sell/trade group where the need for an easy and intuitive digital payment system is available.

				<h2>Research</h2>

		<p>
			I began by defining the problem for the case study then performing research based
			on similar applications such as PayPal, Zelle, and CashApp to develop a competitive edge.

			<h2>Ideation</h2>
			<p>
				Once a general foundation of PlutoPay was established, user interviews, stories, and
				task analysis helped towards later building the low fidelity wireframes.
				Creating user flows allowed me to develop process and decision points.
				Actions such as creating an account, sending money, and viewing reports were better understood.
			</p>
			<p>
				Affinity Maps played a significant role by understanding the behaviors, attitudes, goals, needs,
				and frustrations. Information collected at this point helped in making critical functionality decisions.
			</p>

						<h2>Wireframes</h2>
						<p>
							I started the design process with low fidelity wireframes sketches.
							This is typically how I jot down ideas before moving towards mid fidelity wireframes. Once low fidelity
							sketches were developed, mid fidelity designs were created to build the first prototype.
							User testing let us discover what changes needed to be made based off participant feedback.
							The collected data from usability tests was essential towards the high fidelity prototype.

								<h2>Prototype</h2>
						<p>
							This prototype only showcases primary functions of the user experience and is not a
							fully developed application. Since we wanted to focus on three major functions:
							send money, view reports, and create a budget, the prototype was formed around
							completing these specific tasks.
            </p>

<!-- CONCLUSION-->
<div>
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>
		As someone who likes to manage their finances and monitor their spending habits,
		I believe PlutoPay does an excellent job with providing the appropriate tools to do so.
		Most people tend to spend a lot of money on take out food or online shopping,
		disregarding how much their finances have been impacted. Budgeting on the app is a
		considerably useful feature for financial responsibility, as well as easy access
		to funds or online shopping. The minimalistic design approach makes the overall
		experience enjoyable while managing your finances.
